# SDL Tutor

Welcome to SDL Tutor, a beginner-friendly tutorial series aimed at helping you learn the basics of game development using the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library.

## Introduction

SDL is a powerful cross-platform development library designed to provide low-level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D. It's commonly used for developing games, multimedia applications, and emulators.

SDL Tutor aims to guide you through the fundamental concepts of SDL programming, starting from setting up your development environment to creating your first simple game.
